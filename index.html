<title>Zen IT</title>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Concept</h2>
With the growth of technology, people across the world are becoming further and further away from the fundamentals of life, disconnected and "living in the computer".<br>
On the opposite spectrum, Zen, a way of thinking and living studied over thousands of years, focuses on bringing human beings back to the core, fully present in every moment, through simple acts such as sitting meditation (Zazen).<br>
<br>
When it comes to life, technology and meditation are perhaps opposite forces. However, what if we could mix the two? ... that is exactly what I intend to do in Eiheiji town of Fukui, Japan!<br>

<br>
The Silicon Valley, my hometown, is the richest and most technologically advanced region in the United States of America.<br>
On the other hand, Eiheiji town, the home of Soto Zen, is one of the most&nbsp;<i>philosophically&nbsp;</i>advanced and happiest regions in Japan and the world.<br>
<br/>
シリコンバレーの最先端の技術と禅の心豊かな生き方を混ぜた「禅プログラミング」というなの新しいトレンドを始めたいと思います。
